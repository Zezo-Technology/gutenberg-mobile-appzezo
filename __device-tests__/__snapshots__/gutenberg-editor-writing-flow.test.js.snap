<p>This isn’t your typical work from home job. Everyone works from the location they choose. We’re spread out all over the world in 93 countries. We track about 70 percent of our projects on&nbsp;<a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2-themed</a>&nbsp;WordPress.com blogs, 25 percent in private chat rooms, and the rest on Slack. Because of the geographic variance, we’re active 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you put&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>When you make it past the interview stage&nbsp;<a href="https://automattic.com/what-to-expect-during-a-trial/">we’ll do a project together on contract</a>, typically lasting between two to six weeks depending on how much time you can spend, to see how we work together (learn more about our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://automattic.com/global-hiring-guidelines/" target="_blank">global hiring guidelines</a>). When you join full-time, you’ll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first two weeks and spend a week in support annually, for evermore, regardless of your position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable. (If you’re applying for an engineering position, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/how-we-hire-developers/">learn more about the process you can expect</a>.)</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to the pandemic, we would get the whole company together once a year for seven days so Automatticians could create bonds that influence them all year long. Since the pandemic, we are focusing on smaller groups, division meetups, and so on, that accomplish the bonding and coworking on a more manageable (and safer!) scale. Awesome places we’ve met include San Francisco, California; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, Québec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; San Diego, California; Santa Cruz, California;&nbsp;Park City, Utah; Whistler, Canada; Orlando, Florida; London, England; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Madrid, Spain; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and many more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to our larger meetups, individual teams meet for five to seven days to brainstorm team-level strategy and bond in locales ranging from Boulder to Buenos Aires, Las Vegas to Lisbon, Montréal to Mexico City, and Vienna to Vietnam. If you join our merry band, expect to travel three to four weeks per&nbsp;year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a distributed company, we also know how to connect with each other from afar, and consider&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://automattic.com/social-communication/" target="_blank">day-to-day social communication</a>&nbsp;at least as important as breaking bread in person.</p>

<p>For every feature we launch, we gather metrics about its usage, interaction, and growth in addition to listening to the masses of feedback we get on our blog and through support channels. This helps us inform decisions about new features and enhancements. It’s not uncommon to launch a feature and then iterate immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>We have a one-button deploy system for WordPress.com, and we push code to the site 60–80 times a day. WordPress.com is synced with the WordPress.org trunk pretty much every weekday.&nbsp;<strong>We’re strong believers in&nbsp;<a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a></strong>, and we try to open source everything we can.</p>
